Some days ago I looked at my old website, and I realized that it was time to update it. I started to create this website to share my knowledge and my experience with the open source world. I decided to start with something simple, but I wanted to use the latest technologies.
The idea behind this new website was to start with something easy to develop and then, incrementally, improve it.

I decided to use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com/) to create the UI of the website, this because Tailwind offers a lot of templates and components, this speed-up the work.
My website is built with React + Next.Js, I used Next.Js because I wanted to use the SSR for improve my website SEO.

The most interesting part of this website is the blog, right now you're reading my post, written in an .MDX file, and then, transformed in a React component. I used MDX to write my posts, because I wanted to use the power of React inside my posts, and I wanted to use the power of Markdown to write it.
The issue with this approach is that every time I want to update my blog I've to push my code and restart the development server. The best approach would be to use an Headless CMS like [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/), but I wanted to keep this website as simple as possible.
